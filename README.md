- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m YOUNG

Data mining is rapidly evolving and gaining popularity, especially for social science data. Nowadays, societies produce a lot of written information through news, social media, policy, and legal documents. 

Text data is the future of data science and analytics. Academics and research agencies use data mining to measure data, detect patterns and trends in real-time, understand text sentiments, uncover crucial insights, and construct prediction models. Furthermore, predictive models and data classification help solve economic, financial, and political issues. 

Especially in the Middle East and Africa studies, research data is also scarce and difficult to gather. Data mining can be a welcome rain in such areas. This lecture introduces numerical representations of text data. To demonstrate how these tools can solve economic, financial, and political issues. 
Within the lecture, there will be a workshop. Students will learn to create computer programmes to analyse real-world data, from raw text to understanding and visualising the finished data using R. This lecture will take the entire data mining and analysis process. 

The course will use Quanteda, an online library for textual data analysis. Students will learn text analysis in R and use their skills in diverse real-world case studies. 
This technical training uses R coding. Algebra and calculus knowledge are recommended but not required. It also helps to know a functional or object-oriented programming language. Use "R" for lectures, class activities, and assignments but do not know how to speak or write. 

The course will cover popular text data collection, processing, and analysis methods. Approaches are supervised and unsupervised. 
The training will cover topics such as: 

- Web scraping methods use
- Text cleaning and preprocessing 
- Dictionary methods 
- Machine learning approaches
- Topic modelling
- Scaling with applied statistics
